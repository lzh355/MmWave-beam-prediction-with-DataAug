# Efficient Learning for mmWave Beam Prediction with Data Augmentation

This folder includes deep learning codes and corresponding results.

The folder is free to use, including dataset utilization, simulation result reproduction, model improvement, etc.

## Note:
1. Environment: Pytorch, Python 3.8.0. MATLAB R2023b.
2. Run train.py to start simulations of our proposed approach.
3. The files getpos.m, hatchfill2.m, and legendflex.m are utilized to assist in drawing the results.
